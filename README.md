## Coffee In Office - Blog
This repository hosts my [blog](https://coffeeinoffice.com) that is based on Jekyll and Github Pages. It is a room for thought and experimentation! I write their on everything around ServiceNow, Leaderhip, my blog setup and whatever else keeps me in the writing flow. Feel free to follow and most important - dring a cup of coffee when you read on!
