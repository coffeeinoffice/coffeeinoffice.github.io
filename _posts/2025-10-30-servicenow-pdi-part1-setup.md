As an autodidact who loves learning by himself by figuring things out via trial and error, ServiceNow offers something I haven't seen by any of software vendor, at least in the area of ITSM tools. I know ServiceNow is way more than ITSM or a ticketing tool and at work we use it for all kind of processes like project management or risk managment. As product owner and solution architect I have to deal with a lot of different modules of the platform, therefore I really like what ServiceNow offers as a playground to their community.

If you are like me and want some hands on experience without breaking your work environment, you can get a fullblown ServiceNow instance for yourself called a personal developer instance (PDI). With this you can explore new areas of ServiceNow, new plugins or just play around with an out of the box setup.

This offer is something that really strengthens the community and skill set amongst interested people because you can actually work on an instance, do whatever you want and figure out how ServiceNow works. And all of this is **_for free_**!

## Your way to a personal developer instance

In case you got excited and want to explore the world of ServiceNow and how things work, you can already register and join [ServiceNow University](https://learning.servicenow.com/now/lxp/home) and / or you can request your personal developer instance (PDI) to get started with exploring the platform on your own.

**To setup your PDI:**
1. _Create_ an **account** and login to [https://developer.servicenow.com/](https://developer.servicenow.com/)
2. _Click_ on **Request Instance**.
3. _Select_ the **release** you want your instance running on.
4. _Wait_ until you **get a notification** that your PDI is ready.
5. _Login_ to **your PDI** and enjoy exploring

Once your PDI is ready you can login as admin and explore the System. You can create new records in any table, setup new workflows, explore the world of coding and so on.

This is just the starting point on your learning journey and as said, it is currently still for free so use it and share your experiences within the [ServiceNow Community](https://www.servicenow.com/community/) who is always willing to help!

In the next part of this series I will show you how I setup a custom app that helps me setting up my PDI faster and with my personal preferences. This can be useful in case of loosing your PDI for whatever reason or if you want to start from scratch.
