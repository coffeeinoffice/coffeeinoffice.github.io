## Get something started
Wohoo, new blog. I'm excited. Really. It's been years since I have written my last blog article or worked on a public website. I was totally into working on a corporate career, learning new tools, guiding people and learning to lead - besides drinking coffee and enjoying life. 

After some ways into the world of online games in my free time, I somehow realised I missed writing content on a blog. I missed bringing my thoughts to live and share it with you. Therefore I started this little blog which is totally different than what I was doing with blogging in the past.

## No CMS, just Markdown and Git
Since I can imagine I always started my blogs or websites with a CMS system, mostly Wordpress. This time I really wanted to focus on writing. It is all about content and less about technology. Of course I will still write about technology and what were the reasons to move away from another CMS blog, but the main reason is really to just write and not fizzly around too much with technology.

Don't get me wrong, I'm somehow a techi. I work in IT and I like testing and playing around with new software to figure out how these tools can help me get more organized, streamline or automate processes or enable a totally new business model. But when it comes to telling a story it is not about the little bits and bites we all love, it is about the experience and words that will hopefully inspire you all day on your journey.

Therefore, this time I decided to set on markdown blogging (wohoo back to the '90s). In combination with Github, some awesome tool I never really digged into, I thought this could be a cool start for the getting back to blogging. I know that the blog technology I use is just for some of you interesting and I try to not get too much into the setup and details but I will share some more details for sure, so stay tuned and sip on your cup of coffee.

## What is this all about
I don't think I have a focus yet for this blog. I just want to start writing about what comes to my mind and interests me. This might be a little story from the world of business, this might be something technology related or it might get more into philosophy and life perspectives. There is no plan to shrink this page down to just one little niche, no plan to monetize this or whatever. This is just focusing on creating something and enjoy creating content instead of just consuming.
